# The Effect of 401k Eligibility on Financial Wealth

In this brief illustration, we use data from the 1991 wave of the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP), originally analyzed by [Poterba, Venti & Wise (1995)](https://doi.org/10.1016/0047-2727(94)01462-W), to study how the 401(k) retirement plan affects individualsâ€™ net financial assets. Specifically, our goal is to estimate the average treatment effect of 401(k) eligibility (`e401`) on net financial assets (`net_tda`).

## Data preparations

The main variables of interest are:

| Variable | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| `net_tfa` |  Net total financial assets (outcome) |
| `e401` | 401(k) eligibility |
| `p401` | 401(k) participation |
| `age` | Age of the head of the household |
| `tw` | Total wealth |
| `inc` | Household income |
| `fsize` | Household size |
| `db` | Defined benefit pension status indicator |
| `marr` | Married indicator |
| `twoearn` | Two-earner status indicator |
| `pira` | IRA participation indicator |
| `hown` | House ownership indicator |


We load the data into R/Stata and prepare the data.

                  "twoearn", "pira", "hown")

## Model specification

Before we can run the DML estimation, we need to select a nuisance function estimator. This could be linear regression or almost any supervised machine learner (satisfying a mild congerence rate requirement; see Section 3 in the paper). While the choice of the machine learner is important and can affect the estimation results, we focus here for illustration on random forests with 1000 trees and a maximum tree depth of 4 and 8 for the treatment and outcome equation.

> `ddml::mdl_ranger()` is a wrapper of `ranger::ranger()`. To learn which tuning parameter you can set, check the help file with `?ddml::mdl_ranger`. A number of other wrapper commands are included in the `ddml` package and you can also write your own wrapper commands, see [this guide](https://thomaswiemann.com/ddml/articles/new_ml_wrapper.html).

```
# Define model configuration
learners = list(
  list(fun = mdl_ranger,
       args = list(num.trees = 1000, # random forest
                   max.depth = 8)))

learners_DX = list(
  list(fun = mdl_ranger,
       args = list(num.trees = 1000, # random forest
                   max.depth = 4)))

## The effect of 401k elligibility

We replicate the DML estimate of the average treatment effects of 401k elligibility reported in Table 1, last column. Using the above random forest learners, we now estimate two different target paramters with DML: the partially linear regression coefficient and the average treatment effect.

We use `ensemble_type = "average"` to disable stacking.

```
# DML estimation of the PLR coefficient
plm_fit <- ddml_plm(y, D, X,
                     learners = learners,
                     learners_DX = learners_DX,
                     sample_folds = 10,
                     ensemble_type = "average")

# DML estimation of the ATE 
ate_fit <- ddml_ate(y, D, X,
                     learners = learners,
                     learners_DX = learners_DX,
                     sample_folds = 10,
                     ensemble_type = "average",
                     trim = 0.001)
summary(ate_fit)

# create texreg-compatible object from `late_lasso`
library(texreg)
ate_texreg <- createTexreg(coef.names="elligibility",
                              coef=summary(ate_fit)[1],
                              se=summary(ate_fit)[2],
                              pvalues=summary(ate_fit)[4]
                              )

screenreg(list(plm_fit$ols_fit,ate_texreg),
          include.ci=FALSE,
          custom.coef.map=list("D_r"="elligibility",

## The effect of 401k enrollment

The data also includes information on whether individuals signed up to the 401k scheme, see `p401`. This allows us to estimate to different parameters: the local average treatment effect and the partially linear IV regression coefficient.
