## The Effect of 401k Eligibility on Financial Wealth

In this brief illustration, we replicate the DML estimate of the average treatment effects reported in Table 1, last column. We use data from the 1991 wave of the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP), originally analyzed by [Poterba, Venti & Wise (1995)](https://doi.org/10.1016/0047-2727(94)01462-W), to study how the 401(k) retirement plan affects individualsâ€™ net financial assets. Specifically, our goal is to estimate the average treatment effect of 401(k) eligibility (`e401`) on net financial assets (`net_tda`).

## Data preparations

The main variables of interest are:

| Variable | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| `net_tfa` |  Net total financial assets (outcome) |
| `e401` | 401(k) eligibility |
| `p401` | 401(k) participation |
| `age` | Age of the head of the household |
| `tw` | Total wealth |
| `inc` | Household income |
| `fsize` | Household size |
| `db` | Defined benefit pension status indicator |
| `marr` | Married indicator |
| `twoearn` | Two-earner status indicator |
| `pira` | IRA participation indicator |
| `hown` | House ownership indicator |


We load the data into R/Stata and prepare the data.

# Extract variables

D <- dat$e401
X <- as.matrix(dat[, control_names])

## Model specification

Before we can run the DML estimation, we need to select a nuisance function estimator. This could be linear regression or almost any supervised machine learner. While the choice of the machine learner is important can can affect the results, we focus here for illustration on random forests with 1000 trees and a maximum tree depth of 4 and 8 for the treatment and outcome equation.

```
# Define model configuration
learners = list(
  list(fun = mdl_ranger,
       args = list(num.trees = 1000, # random forest
                   max.depth = 8)))

learners_DX = list(
  list(fun = mdl_ranger,
       args = list(num.trees = 1000, # random forest
                   max.depth = 4)))
```

## Estimation

Using these random forest learners, we now estimate two different target paramters with DML: the partially linear regression coefficient and the average treatment effect.

Note that we opt for 10 cross-fitting golds and we use `ensemble_type = "average"` to
