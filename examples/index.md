# Examples

On this page, we discuss three applications:
 
- "The Effect of 401k Eligibility on Financial Wealth" is an introductory toy example that shows you how you can estimate partially linear (IV) regression coefficients, average treatment effects and local average treatment effects using DML.
- "Understanding Cultural Persistence and Change" is focuses on the partially linear model. The application illustrates how to employ DML in practice, and highlights some of the most important pitfalls.
- "Dynamic Effects on Hospitalization" showcasts how you can use DML estimation in difference-in-differences designs under conditional parallel trends assumptions.

We provide both R and Stata code for you to run these examples. You can also find the complete replication code for the JEL paper here: **link to be added**.
